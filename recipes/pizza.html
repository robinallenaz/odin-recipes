    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A recipe for baklava</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 tbsp table salt</li>
        <li>2 cups of lukewarm water</li>
        <li>Ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil (optional)</li>
        <li>5 1/2 to 6 cups of King Arthur Pizza Flour Blend</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve the sugar, yeast, and salt in the lukewarm water (and olive oil, if you're using it).</li>
        <li>Add the flour and Pizza Dough Flavor, starting with 5 1/2 cups (660g) flour and adding more as necessary to make a soft, smooth dough.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough (with your hands, a mixer, or your bread machine set on the dough cycle) until it's smooth and elastic, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl or other container, cover it, and let it rise for 1 to 2 hours, whatever fits your schedule.</li>
        <li>Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into four pieces, for medium-crust pizza; or three pieces, for thicker crusts. Use a rolling pin to roll each piece, on a lightly greased surface, into a circle to fit a 12" pizza pan. Let the dough rest several times to relax it and make it more cooperative. If you prefer a more artisan look to your crust, with scattered random air pockets throughout, hand-stretch the dough to size. Again, letting it rest periodically makes the job easier.</li>
        <li>Place the rounds on pizza pans; on baking sheets; or, if you have a pizza stone in your oven, on parchment.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 450°F. While it's heating, get out your toppings, which you've prepared ahead. Some possibilities include sliced pepperoni; sautéed mushrooms, onions, or peppers; cooked meats; olives; anchovies; and grated or shredded cheese.</li>
        <li>Brush each crust with a bit of olive oil; spread pizza or spaghetti sauce lightly over the surface, and let your guests add their favorite toppings. Sprinkle the top with grated cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizzas for 15 to 20 minutes, until they're golden brown, the toppings are hot and bubbly, and the cheese is melted. Remove the pizzas from the oven.</li>
        <li>Immediately transfer pizzas to a cooling rack, so their bottoms don't get soggy. After about 10 minutes (to allow the toppings to set), slice and serve; a pair of scissors is a great cutting tool.</li>
